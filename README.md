# retail-ecommerce_customer-voice-sales-and-behaviour-prediction

### **Preface:**
This is a project MVP (minimum viable product) for sales and consumer behavior analysis and follow-up. Featuring full automation of customer voice analysis using NLP (Natural Language Processing) and customer segmentation through unsupervised learning. And for this purpose I have used the anonymized data of a retail e-commerce company similar to Ebay.

### **Documents:**
There is a PowerPoint that goes together with a 10 minute presentation in the links below. Together with an Entity-Relationship Diagram to explain the database model I used for this project.

### **Methodology:**
I have used Python 3.x in a Jupyter Notebook. Presented the MVP to an audience of 50+ people and recorded it on video in the links below. Asisting documents are the powerpoint presentation and the ERD diagram so that the viewer can follow the presentation along.
Part of the story telling and PowerPoint format are based on the decision to discover the ecommerce, project and results through the presentation with no "spoilers".
