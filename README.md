# retail-ecommerce_customer-voice-sales-and-behaviour-prediction

This is a project MVP (minimum viable product) for sales and consumer behavior analysis and follow-up. Featuring full automation of customer voice analysis using NLP (Natural Language Processing) and customer segmentation through unsupervised learning.

There is a PowerPoint that goes together with a 10 minute presentation in the links. Together with an Entity-Relationship Diagram to explain the "simplyfied" database model I used for this project.
